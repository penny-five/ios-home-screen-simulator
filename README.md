:construction: **Work in progress** :construction: :construction_worker: :factory:

Live demo available at https://ios-home-screen-simulator.netlify.app.

## What is this?

A replica of iOS home screen built with Vue 3. This tries not to be 1:1 pixel perfect copy with all the bells and whistles but rather a good imitation.

## Why?

For no particular reason other than to learn Vue 3.

## How?

Vue 3 + Tailwind.css mostly. The app is bundled with Webpack and deployed to Netlify using a Github Actions workflow.
